Installation for the vanilla launcher is much improved these days, you're in luck.

## Create a New Profile with the Installer

Download the [**latest Fabric Installer**]({% link _tabs/download.md %}) from our download page.

Make sure the vanilla launcher is not running and start the installer. Select "Install".

Open the launcher and you should see a new profile was created.

## Add Better Than Wolves to the Profile

Navigate to your `.minecraft/` folder, and **create a new folder** called `mods`.

If there was already a `mods/` folder, make a backup and empty it instead.

Now, **download the [latest Cursed BTW]({% link _tabs/download.md %})** from our download page, and put it in that folder.

You are now ready to launch the new profile!
