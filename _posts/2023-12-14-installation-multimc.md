Installation on [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) or forks like [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) is really easy.

## Import the instance

Download the [latest MultiMC instance]({% link _tabs/download.md %}) from our download page.

Next, in your launcher, add a new instance and [import the zip file](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/wiki/Import-Instance) we just downloaded.
