## Can I use Optifine?

Optifine is not compatible with BTW, but BTW is already optimized to run better than vanilla. On top of that, we have the [Neodymium](https://github.com/BTW-Community/Neodymium/releases/latest) addon. Make sure you are on a Java version lower than 17 (we use 8) and put the mod in the `/mods` folder (or Loader Mods for MultiMC forks).

Additionally, make sure advanced opengl and vsync are off in the Minecraft settins, and use the "Max FPS" option.

## Why are my textures all flat?

If you have an Nvidia GPU, check this: https://discord.com/channels/252863009590870017/252940065804648448/1168172555476148274

Otherwise, use the Neodymium addon from the previous question.
