## Which launcher should I use?

We recommend [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) or any of the forks like [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).


## How do I install BTW?

Installation guide: <https://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?t=10201>


## What version of Java should I use?

The mod is developed using Java 8, but in theory you can go up as high as 16. If you want a stable version of Java, that means you should go with either 8 or 11. We recommend using [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8) (make sure to select the x64 version)


## How do I install extra addons for BTW?

For modern Fabric addons, you just put them in the `/mods` folder, or add them to the Loader Mods tab in MultiMC/Prism!
You probably want to grab Craftguide for recipe support: <https://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?t=10181>

More addons and texture packs can be found here: <https://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewforum.php?f=12>


## How do I get started with BTW?

Unfortunately the wiki is fairly out of date, so we recommend using Craftguide for recipes, but we do have a decent Beginner's Guide: <https://sargunster.com/btw/index.php/Beginner%27s_Guide>
